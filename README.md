# so_long
Bask in late-90's gaming nostalgia!

![2022-01-15 11-40-40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49699403/149626600-089dc518-8d8e-4f39-a3a4-fd35f82169b9.gif)

This is my first 2D game, built with a custom graphic interface library that allows for window drawing and events handling. The sprites (from Game Freak/Nintendo's classic PokÃ©mon Yellow) were retrieved from the internet, although I did the colouring myself.

The game is initiated by a map file in the ```.ber``` format containing only the following valid characters:
``` c
# define VALID_MAP_CHARS	"EPC10TJ"
```
- E stands for _exit_
- P stands for _player_
- C for _collectibles_
- 1 for _walls_
- 0 for _floor_
- T and J are other pokÃ©mon _trainers_

The player must guide Pikachu around the map (movement constrained by walls); the goal is to clear the level by collecting all the pokÃ©balls on the floor and escape the scene through the exit, while avoiding the threat of Rocket Team!

This project is not meant to be a fully-fledged game, rather an introduction to a minimal, event-wise graphic library, developed over the course of 2-3 weeks.

_You can find more about the making of this project [over here](https://rodsmade.notion.site/Acelera-So_long-e5caded24d7b434aa1cb5daf73636fb9) (in Portuguese ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·)_

## Directories
* ```bin/```
	Where the final executable binary file goes.

* ```headerfiles/``` 
	Keeps all the custom-made .h header files used in the project.

* ```libs/``` 
	Keeps the local custom-made library Libft (see [this project](https://github.com/rodsmade/Projets_42_SP/tree/main/projets_obligatoires/1_libft) for reference), which comprises some of the string handling functions, for instance.

* ```objs/``` 
	Keeps all the .o files produced throughout the compilation process.

* ```resources/images``` 
	All the sprites used in the game in the ```.xpm``` format.

* ```resources/maps``` 
	Some preset maps used for running and testing the game. Some are purposefully invalid and shouldn't be allowed to open the game.

* ```srcs/```
	Where all the good stuff goes!

## Run the game
### Linux and MacOS
Please follow the instructions in [this repo](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux#readme) in order to install the necessary packets to run Minilibx

### Windows
You'll need to install Xserver in your machine seeing as the library runs on X-Window system. You may also use WSL on Windows 11 and run ```wsl --update``` and you should be good to go.

### Clone repo and run
``` c
git clone https://github.com/rodsmade/Projets_42_SP.git
make run MAP=<path to map>
```
You can use one of the preset maps in ```./resources/maps```, or you could even make a map of your own!

Game on! :)

## Final note
If you're a 42 student struggling to understand this project, I got your back! Please refer to this Notion page that I wrote covering the general concepts related to this project! It's in Portuguese :cactus:
